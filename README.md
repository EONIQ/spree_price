# Spree Price

Heavily inspired by [spree-contrib/spree_price_book](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_price_books).
1. Support multiple store price
2. Support multiple type of prices (e.g. sales price, marked price, manufacturer's suggested retail price
3. Support price book. Price book can be prioritized at store.
4. Auto adjust prices according to exchange rate. 
5. Price is found by the following order.
    - Manual set price
    - Price book with higher priority in the same store
    - First price matching the currency and price type
    - First price matching the currency
    TODO: Find the price from parent price type without sacrificing the performance too much

6. The price will not be populated from parent price type by default. You can either fill nil prices from parent price book with adjustment factor or refresh all prices from parent price book in admin panel.

7. Line item and order will save all prices for each price type.

### Installation
Add spree_price_books to your Gemfile:

```shell
gem 'spree_price_books', github: 'EONIQ/spree_price'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:
```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_price:install
```

### Configuration
Once installed you can seed default currency exchange rates via open exchange rate

Get your app id from https://openexchangerates.org/signup

Add open_exchange_rate.rb to config/initializers
```ruby
Rails.application.config.openExchangeRate = {
  appId: 'YOUR APP ID HERE',
}
```

```shell
bundle exec rake spree_price:currency_rates
```

### Testing
First bundle your dependencies, then run rake. rake will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using rake test_app.

On the first run you may need to create the Postgresql role (ex. createuser -d postgres)

```
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories. Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```
require 'spree_price/factories'
```
